# Node-CRUD-App

To run the programm only 2 commands need to be run:
1. **_npm install_**: To install all the dependecies.
1. **_npm start_**: To run the programm

**Note**: There are two parts in the app.js file which are commented and explained where user needs to provide his/her own secret key and URL to MongoDb. The other solution is to use Dotenv file and have all your required data in your Dotenv file and and name them exactly like the names given in the application.
